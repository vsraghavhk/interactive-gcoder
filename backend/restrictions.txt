E_rate is between 0 and 1
User can not set fixed E rate/value.

radius needs to be less than 100mm

edge length needs to be less than 200/(n-2) mm
    200 for a triangle. 
    100 for square. 

Radius can not be changed ? (Optional, but needs alerts and calc)

All sides are equal

number of sides can be 1 to inifinite
num_sides CAN NOT BE 0 !!!!!!


User can input filename to save

Ranges:
    Z_shift = 0.1 to 5
    Bed_temp = 0 to 70
    Nozzle_temp = 200 to 280
    E_rate = 0 to 1 (in mm of filament per cm of print)
    F_rate = 500 to 3000
    E_mode = 1 (For Absolute) or 0 (for relative)
    num_sides = 2 to infinite (2 will produce a line)
    edge_length = 1mm to 50mm (Depends on edge radius)
    radius = 1mm to 100mm
    num_layers = 1 to 200/Z_shift
    wave_amp = 0.1 mm to 50 (Anything amplitude more radius has a chance to tip over. But user should be able to enter anyway)
    random_value = 1 to 10
    func_choice = {
        1 : Straight
        2 : Spiral
        3 : Wave
        4 : Screw
        5 : Random
        6 : Shift
        7 : Shift and turn
    }
